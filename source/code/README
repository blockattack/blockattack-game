Thanks for downloading Block Attack - Rise Of the Blocks 1.4.2 for Linux and other Platforms

Version 1.4.2

scons must be present on the system to compile. (There is a make file but it is mostly for development and unpriviliged compiling, NEVER use "make install"!)

To build:
scons
scons install (as root)

The game can be ran by double clicking "starter" in the "Game" directory. (Only if build with the make file)

If it doesn't work (because your distro uses an old stdc++ file, is not Linux or you are running 64 bit you will need to compile)

Alternativly it can be build with a classic Makefile:
cd source/code
make
make run

If you get errors you might need certain packages on your system.

Dependencies:
On Ubunut the required packages are to run are: libsdl1.2debian-all, libsdl-image1.2, libsdl-mixer1.2 and libenet
To compile: build-essential, libsdl1.2-dev, libsdl-image1.2-dev, libsdl-mixer1.2-dev and libenet-dev

By default the game is now placed in: /usr/local/bin/blockattack
This means that it can be runned by just typing "blockattack"
