## Screen shot
![Block Attack - Rise of the Blocks](https://blockattack.github.io/images/screenshots/blockattack-2.3.0-3.png "Screen shot")

## Dependencies
* A version of g++ with C++11 support. Tested on g++-4.9
* libSDL2
* libSDL2_image
* libSDL2_mixer
* libSDL2_ttf
* libphysfs
* libfmt
* libboost (only needed for compiling)
* libboost-program-options

## Building
The only supported build method is using the CMake<br/>
To build do:
```
./packdata.sh
cmake .
# or
# cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .
# or
# cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .
make
```
The result should be in the "Game"-folder. To run
```
./Game/blockattack
```

You can also choose to install it with
```
sudo make install
```

Windows build uses MXE (mxe.cc) and Docker. See "Building with Docker".


## Building using Docker

As getting a C++ project with many dependencies to compile can be a daunting task then I have provided a couple of Docker images that can perform a build. Both for Windows and Linux.

The project should at all time be able to compile on the oldest and latest supported version of Ubuntu. This is tested with Docker.

On a fresh checkout you can use:
```
docker build -f source/misc/docker/Dockerfile.Ubuntu18.04build . -t blockattack_test
```
and
```
docker build -f source/misc/docker/Dockerfile.WindoesBuild . -t blockattack_test
```

## Source Structure
This project is a bit unconventional because I didn't know any better at the time.

* Game - The output is placed here
* man - The manual file and the script to generate it. May be moved to source/misc at some point
* source/code/ - The source code
* source/code/Libs - External libs that are compiled into the project because they are either header only (Cereal) or not designed for use as a shared library.
* source/code/sago - Source code. Not designed to be specific to Block Attack - Rise of the Blocks
* source/assets - Source for the assets if relevant. For instance svg source for the graphics.
* source/misc - Misc stuff. Code related tool that are used for development but not part of the final product.
* source/misc/astyle - Helper script that enforces code style using the "astyle"-program
* source/misc/cmake - Files needed by CMake
* source/misc/docker - Docker files used by Travis CI  (but can just as well be used for local testing and release builds)
* source/misc/icons - Icons for the installer
* source/misc/screenshots - Screen shots like the one in this README file.
* source/misc/translation - Translations and related tools and scripts
* source/misc/travis_help - Helper files for Travis CI
* windows installer - Information needed to Windows installer. May be moved to source/misc at some point

## Reporting bugs

Please report bugs on github: <https://github.com/blockattack/blockattack-game/issues>
If possible: Check if the bug is already fixed in master. But if you don't know how to check it then just report it.

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome. Both the current graphics and the original sharedir support was provided by kind individuals.
Patches can be attached to a github ticket or sent to poul@poulsander.com directly. You can also create pull requests on Github.
